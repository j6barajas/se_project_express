# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

This back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. The application displays the current weather for a particular location and generates cards with clothing items that are appropriate for the weather. This project uses MongoDB to create the server and Express.js to build the application.

The domains for the front-end are: wtwr.fiat500.li, www.wtwr.fiat500.li.
The domain for the back-end is: api.wtwr.fiat500.li.
